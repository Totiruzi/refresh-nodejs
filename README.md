## How to use the .env file

To set up your project environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following content:

PORT=5000 
JWT_SECRET="Some_secret_string"


Note: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Instead, add it to your `.gitignore` file.
